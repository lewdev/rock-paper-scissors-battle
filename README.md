# rock-paper-scissors-battle
Watch simulation of emoji Rock, Paper, Scissors battle it out.

This simulates Rock, Paper, and Scissors initially placed randomly around the screen and then chasing after their nearest prey. It's interesting to see the outcomes being completely random.

Press any key, click, or tap to reset. Otherwise the game restarts itself.

This was an attempt to create something for the [JS1024](https://js1024.fun/) (2021). I started on this just after the deadline so I wasn't planning on submitting it but rather just see if I could create something for it.

Turns out, it's very hard to do and getting even a small app down to 1024 bytes seems impossible.
